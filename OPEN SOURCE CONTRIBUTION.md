- Why we are talking about this ?

- We are talking about this because these all are based on the open source .

- But the biggest question lies here is what is open source ?

- So let's go and explore this in more brief .

  

# WHAT IS OPEN SOURCE ?

  

- It is defined as source code that is made freely available for possible modification and redistribution .

- It means the source code of the open source softwares are public .

- It means you can play with the code , modify it , remove the bugs from it .

- This openness enables collaboration .

  

## OPEN SOURCE CONTRIBUTION

  

- It means contributing to the development or improvement of open - source software .

- It boost the chances of getting the opportunity in the big firms like google and all .

  

  

## OPPORTUNITIES IN OPEN SOURCE

  

### EXPERIENCE

  

- It gives us the opportunities to work with great software engineers around the world which helps in building the connection .

- It also helps us to get in touch with the community and market .

  

### BENEFITS

  

- It helps in learning best code practices .

- Helps in building online reputation .

- Makes your resume powerful and attraction .

- It helps you to write and learn the clean code practices .

- It helps you to improve our communication skills .

  

## 4 GOLDEN STEPS TO ENTER THE OPEN SOURCE WORLD

  

### LEARN A SKILL

  

- Web development .

- Android development .

- Machine learning .

- Technical writing .

  

In learning skill you not have to be pro instead you can start with the basic knowledge .

  

### LEARN VERSION CONTROL

  

- Basic git command .

- Forking a project .

- Commit and push your changes .

  

### FIND AN ORGANISATION

  

- In order to do the open source contributions you will have to find the open source softwares .

- So , There are several ways in order to do the open source contributions .

- You can find the opportunities in the big players like firefox and android which have the big user base and community in which lot of changes and things are required .

- Once you introduce the changes then millions of people can see the changes .

  

### FIND A BUG / FEATURE

  

- Most of the organisation have "Good first issue "tag which helps beginnners contribute easily .

- Beginners can also find issues by themselves and fix them .

- You can also find out the channels on telegram and slacks in order to communicate regarding the issues and bugs .

  

## STEPS TO DO THE OPEN SOURCE CONTRIBUTION

  

- Search for the project on the open source hosting website like github .

- In this we will take the use of git hub in order to perform our open source contribution.

- So we will have to setup the program locally in order to make an open source contribution.

- So for that clone the code from github and just copy the link .

  

![Untitled](OPEN%20SOURCE%20CONTRIBUTION%20dcc5a871f4ef4f7797182a5fa240db27/Untitled%201.png)

  

- Now create an folder in the local system and open git desktop .

- Now in the git desktop click on the clone the repository and select the clone from url option and paste the url and click on the clone and select the location .

  

![Untitled](OPEN%20SOURCE%20CONTRIBUTION%20dcc5a871f4ef4f7797182a5fa240db27/Untitled%202.png)

  

![Untitled](OPEN%20SOURCE%20CONTRIBUTION%20dcc5a871f4ef4f7797182a5fa240db27/Untitled%203.png)

  

- Now then you will see that the new folder is created and in that all the files are located .

![Untitled](OPEN%20SOURCE%20CONTRIBUTION%20dcc5a871f4ef4f7797182a5fa240db27/Untitled%204.png)

  

![Untitled](OPEN%20SOURCE%20CONTRIBUTION%20dcc5a871f4ef4f7797182a5fa240db27/Untitled%205.png)

  

- Then you check the issue section in the github , where all the issues or the bugs are labelled or written .

  

![Untitled](OPEN%20SOURCE%20CONTRIBUTION%20dcc5a871f4ef4f7797182a5fa240db27/Untitled%206.png)

  

- There find out the label "good first issue" if you are beginner because it includes all the issue tasks .

- Then try to fix the issue in your local enviroment by using your skills .

- In the end we will push the code in the open source repository .

- For pushing the contribution in the repo we will take first add then we will commit and in the end we will create an push request .

- Then fork the repository , it will create an copy of the repository in your account .

  

![Untitled](OPEN%20SOURCE%20CONTRIBUTION%20dcc5a871f4ef4f7797182a5fa240db27/Untitled%207.png)

  

- Then after pushing the code in the branch orign we will create an pull request .

![Untitled](OPEN%20SOURCE%20CONTRIBUTION%20dcc5a871f4ef4f7797182a5fa240db27/Untitled%208.png)

- After this your pull request will become open and in the end the other maintainers will check the pull request and if your pull request is genuine then they will merge this into their master branch .

  

![Untitled](OPEN%20SOURCE%20CONTRIBUTION%20dcc5a871f4ef4f7797182a5fa240db27/Untitled%209.png)

  

- Just click on the pull request .

- I am not doing this because this is not an valid request or the ðŸª² bug which we have fixed .

- So I hope you have understood the process of open source contributions .
